# Workspaces Directory

This directory contains generated project workspaces.

Each workspace is a self-contained project directory with the following structure:

```
workspace-id/
├── src/
│   ├── frontend/     # Frontend source code
│   └── backend/      # Backend source code
├── assets/           # Static assets
├── config/           # Configuration files
├── docs/             # Project documentation
├── tests/            # Test files
└── workspace.json    # Workspace metadata
```

## Note

Workspace contents are dynamically generated and should not be manually edited.
